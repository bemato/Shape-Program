# Shape Program
 A program that gives information about triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles.

Can be used to find areas, circumference, and bounding box sizes for the aforementioned object types. Employs checks for proper parameters in constructors. The display method can be called for each object to display all mentioned properties and details of the object.

I had created this project on an another account. So I had to fork it here.
